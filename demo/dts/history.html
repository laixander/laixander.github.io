                    <p>Kali is one of the oldest philosophies or a way of life. It was established when the Code of Kalantiao was practiced since the Majapahit empire and Sri Visaya. It is a long lost culture of a truly Filipino heritage as before they were called Filipinos, they tagged as tribes of Kali.</p>

                    <p>The philosophical mystic of Kali was lost during the introduction of the European and Western cultures, through religious and educational methods, specifically the Thomasites, yet despite the cultural invasions, a considerable group of practitioners were able to preserve and spearheaded the continuity of this unique and mystical culture.</p>

                    <p>While there were present disputes among Filipinos relating to politics and other foreign philosophies, we were still unsettled and unable to discover the inner kernel of ourselves, which is the “KALI WAY OF LIFE”.</p>

                    <p>When the remnants of Kali practitioners in the country decided its “Kapulungan”, chosen was the “Bala-anBukid”, wherein the Blessed Savior of the cross will rise, with the belief that the Redeemer of the oppressed will come into glory.</p>

                    <p>Kali is the oldest form of weaponry in the Philippines. It comes from the word <em>“KALIS”</em>, which implies the use of the blade. It is a traditional cultural art of the Filipino people which designed for the physical training, mental development and spiritual upliftment of an individual practitioner which will relatively strengthen his moral values of foundation. The naturally graceful and harmonious movements used in this art are characterized of the methods found and used by other Asian Countries.</p>
